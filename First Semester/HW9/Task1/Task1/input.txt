That's real
People act a different way with me
I feel don't nobody wanna play with me
And that's ill cause they treat me like a stain on their clothes
The industry are my foes
They treat me like I got a red nose, red nose, red nose
They put me down
And treat me like I got a red nose, red nose, red nose
Don't make me clown
And have to go put on my red nose
